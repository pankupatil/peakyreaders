- **Elon Musk** the real-life Iron Man was once asked how he learned to build rockets, he says 'I read books. Elon Musk is the billionaire and brilliant mind behind Tesla and SpaceX. Imagine how busy his schedule is..! Still, he carves his time for reading.

- **Warren Buffet** spends 80% of his day reading. He doesn't limit his knowledge to books alone. He also reads six newspapers a day. When Warren Buffet was once asked about the key to success, he said read 500 pages like this every day. That's how knowledge works

- **Bill Gates** is an incredibly busy man, but still, he always makes time to read. In one of the blogs he mentioned..'Even when my schedule is out of control, I carve out a lot of time for reading.' He reads about 50 books per year, which means 1 book per week. According to Gates, reading is still the main way that he learns new things and tests his understanding. He always has a book with him wherever he goes.

- **Mark Zukerberg** works up to 60 hours a week, he once said..'I have found reading books very intellectually fulfilling. Books allow you to fully explore a topic and immerse yourself in a deeper way. I'm looking forward to shifting more of my media diet towards reading books.'

So let me ask you, why do you think these people spend their valuable time reading books? They all are super busy than all of us still, they read a lot...

Obviously, the answer is **'Knowledge'**. The more you read the more you learn.

### You must be thinking, what can I gain by reading books? Let me tell you few advantages of reading books:

- **It reduces stress.** No matter how much stress you have in your daily life let it be work or your personal life, it all goes away when you read a great novel or a great story. When you are reading a novel or any other book, your subconscious mind starts to relate yourself to the character in the book, you engage yourself with the situations, and you keep reading it. In the end, it helps you to relax and reduces your stress.

- **It increases knowledge.** “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.” – Dr. Seuss. Every time you read, your head fills with a piece of new information, and you never know when it might come in handy. Knowledge helps you to tackle any challenges you face in your life. 

- **It increases your vocabulary.** The more you read, the more new words you learn. It just helps you to gain more self-confidence in your professional and personal life.

- **It helps you to increase your inner skills and your analytical thinking.** “Today a reader, tomorrow a leader.” – Margaret Fuller. We all know that most of the successful people's advice is to READ. A few days ago I finished reading "How to stop worrying and start living by Dale Carnegie". In this book, he mentioned that the best way to change others is to change oneself first. He has given some lessons that how one should approach the problems, how we can tackle most of our worries, and be happy. The bottom line is, your mind starts to engage yourself with the situations and in the end, you start thinking differently. You change your approach to deal with your daily issues.

- It also helps for better writing skills, focus and concentration, brings positive energy, memory improvement, and lots of other benefits.

### Here are few tips on how you should start your reading habit:

- **Pick a book of your choice.** Successful people are selective about what they read. They also read about other successful people, their stories, and learning. I would suggest to start with non-fiction books like self-development and autobiographies.

- **Set a time for reading.** Let it be for 30 minutes or 3 hours. That way you can focus on devoting the entire time to reading without any interruptions.

- **Read by topics.**

- **Take side notes.** it's an effective way to learn fast and it will make it easier for you to remember what you've read. According to Bill Gates, always take a pen or pencil before opening your book. Markdown important things, statements, that you think are useful for your daily life.

- **Finish every book you read.** The second principle of Bill Gates is 'get to the end'. Finish one book before you start another one.
